# ðŸ’»RISC-V REFERENCE SOC TAPOUT PROGRAM

From Concept to Silicon: Shape India's Semiconductor Program.

#### Welcome to my journey from RTL TO GDSII SoC Tapeout Program Provided by VSD.

>*"In this program, we learn to design a IC from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."*



### ðŸ“–This repository documents my week-by-week progress with assignments.
