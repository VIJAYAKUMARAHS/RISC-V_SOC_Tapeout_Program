##  üìÖDay 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### Introduction to open-source simulator: iverilog

####  Introduction to iverilog design and test bench

### Simulator

RTL design is checked for adherence to the specification by simulating the design.

The simulator used for this course is Icarus Verilog (iverilog).

### Design

The Design consists of actual Verilog code or a set of Verilog codes that have the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.

### Testbench

The TestBench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its¬†functionality

Note:

- Design may have one or more primary inputs, one or more primary outputs

- TB (Testbench) doesn't have a primary input or primary outputs

### How the simulator works

The simulator continuously checks for changes in input signals.

If there is a change, it evaluates the corresponding output.

If no change to the inputs ‚Üí no change in outputs.

The simulator continuously detecting and reacting to the input signal changes.
